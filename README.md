EBICS Java Client
=====

Fork of the Java open source ebics client project - https://sourceforge.net/p/ebics/

Main differences with this fork:

- Support for French, German and Swiss banks
- Command line client to do the setup, initialization and to download files from the bank
- Use of maven for compilation instead of ant + Makefile + .sh scripts
